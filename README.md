**Introduction:**

It's always wonderful to see services customized to our needs. Businesses try to understand our behaviour and adjust their offerings so as to ensure we feel attached to their services.

Communication Service Providers handle and store a lot of data! They have to deal with millions of users’ call detail records, personal details and transaction data, usage patterns, technical fault data, and location data, to mention some.

To gain insights into the avalanche of data that they have at their disposal, Communication Service Providers are increasingly starting to take helps from the consulting agencies to turn their data into valuable business insights. Following are some of the benefits of consultations:

-   Targeted marketing and Personalization
-   Churn Prediction and Prevention
-   Network Planning, Optimization and Expansion
-   Prevention of Fraud and Revenue Loss
-   Data Monitization

**Project Description:**

**InsaidTelecom**, one of the leading telecom players, understands that customizing offering is very important for its business to stay competitive. **InsaidTelecom** is seeking to leverage behavioural data from more than 60% of the 50 million mobile devices active daily in India to help its clients better understand and interact with their audiences.
Outcome of the project is  to build a dashboard to understand user's demographic characteristics based on their mobile usage, geographic location and mobile device properties. Doing so will help millions of developers and brand advertisers around the world pursue data-driven marketing efforts which are relevant to their users and catered to their preferences.

**Problem Statement:**

For this business problem we had to study the demographics of a user based on their app download and usage behaviours. To help the customer and have an impact on their offerings, we are expected to find user behaviour and suggest the right way forward on the actionable insights with respect to marketing and product terms.

## Project 2:
# EDA on Olympics dataset
![enter image description here](https://github.com/tanucsengg/Machine-Learning-Projects-/blob/main/olympics.jpeg)
## Problem Statement[](http://localhost:8889/notebooks/Desktop/Projects/EDA%20on%20%20Olympics%20dataset%20.ipynb#1.-Problem-Statement)

**Summer Olypmics**  have been conducted in two year within a tenure of four year.The first modern Olympics were held in Athens, Greece, in 1896. In the opening ceremony, King Georgios I and a crowd of 60,000 spectators welcomed 280 participants from 13 nations (all male), who would compete in 43 events, including track and field, gymnastics, swimming, wrestling, cycling, tennis, weightlifting, shooting and fencing. All subsequent Olympiads have been numbered even when no Games take place (as in 1916, during World War I, and in 1940 and 1944, during World War II). The Olympics truly took off as an international sporting event after 1924, when the VIII Games were held in Paris. Some 3,000 athletes (with more than 100 women among them) from 44 nations competed that year, and for the first time the Games featured a closing ceremony. Eighty years later, when the 2004 Summer Olympics returned to Athens for the first time in more than a century, nearly 11,000 athletes from a record 201 countries competed. The Olympics game have huge difference among the various discipline. It is analysed that some disciplines are widely used whereas other one are not that widely used .Gender gap is quite different for the male and Female Athletes of the world. .Olympic Games is the highest sporting event in the world where all the participants participate with their full spirit and try to compete with different  **Gender, Nationality, Sports Events**. We will figure out how the different countries has been performing in the olympic games over the years and understanding the gender role in the oympics is there any relation with their economic prosperity and the no. of medals won by that country.
## Conclusion
-   The first modern Olympics were held in Athens, Greece, in 1896. In the opening ceremony, King Georgios I and a crowd of 60,000 spectators welcomed 280 participants from 13 nations (all male), who would compete in 43 events, including track and field, gymnastics, swimming, wrestling, cycling, tennis, weightlifting, shooting and fencing. All subsequent Olympiads have been numbered even when no Games take place (as in 1916, during World War I, and in 1940 and 1944, during World War II).
-   The Olympics truly took off as an international sporting event after 1924, when the VIII Games were held in Paris. Some 3,000 athletes (with more than 100 women among them) from 44 nations competed that year, and for the first time the Games featured a closing ceremony.
-   Eighty years later, when the 2004 Summer Olympics returned to Athens for the first time in more than a century, nearly 11,000 athletes from a record 201 countries competed.
-   **USA**  has dominated the Olympics all these years with maximum number of Medal Tally.
-   **Australia**  is closely following up and has shown tremendous growth after 1990.
-   Number of Medals in Men Category were highest in 1920 Games and then was considerably reduced and then again was increasing and now showing sign of consolidation.
-   Number of Medals in  **Women Category**  are rising with each games and now showing sign of consolidation.
-   In This Analysis, we can see the trend and rise of Modern Olympics in more than 100 years history and how the popularity of olympics has made them one of the favourite games of every sports person in the every corner of the world.
-   **Male Atheletes**  are more than  **Women Athletes**  but the no. of women also increases over period of time as compared to Men.

## Actionable Insights

-   Action to be taken for more female athlete participation in olympics although the female participation is increasing but it is very less upto now.
-   **USA**  is a leader in terms of medal count but need to see that other countries need to improve their strategies for the olympics.

 ## Project 3:
# Gender Recognition Using KNN and SVM
![enter image description here](https://github.com/tanucsengg/Machine-Learning-Projects-/blob/main/gender.jpeg)
## Problem Statement

The label defines the voice as male or female The main objective is to find a function that can predict wheter the voice belongs to the male or a female using the 20 other features.This database’s goal is to help systems identify whether a voice is male or female based upon acoustic properties of the voice and speech. 
In this Project I have used three algorithm (Nearest Neighbor, SVM, Naive Bayes) to compare the accuracy.

The Three algorithm have been compared in this like Nearest Neighbor, SVM, Naive Bayes Accuracy is highest Nearest Neightbor which is 98 % followed by SVM wih 97 % followed by Naive Bayes 90 % Thus in terms of Acuuracy the Nearest neighbor is the best but other are also doing great as they are giving accuracy more than 90%

## Project 4:
# House Price prediction
![enter image description here](https://github.com/tanucsengg/Machine-Learning-Projects-/blob/main/house%20price%20prediction.jpg)
### Problem Statement

The SalePrice (in dollars) for a particular House as a function of eighty one explanatory variables(EV) explaining all the aspects of the House.

The main objective is to find a function which can predicts the SalePrice of a House using the 81 explanatory variables.

Identification of the features which contribute to the SalePrice.

The relationship between the various features and their response is represented using various visualization methods.
### Conclusion 
-   OverallQual (with 59% importance among all the features) is the most important feature in determining the SalePrice of a House.
-   The other features that influence the SalePrice of a House include GrLivArea, TotalBsmtSF, BsmtFinSF1, 1stFlrSF, GarageArea, TotRmsAbvGrd, BsmtUnfSF, BsmtQual, ExterQual, GarageCars, WoodDeckSF, KitchenQual, LotArea & 2ndFlrSF.
-   The above mentioned 15 features together contribute 93% in determining the SalePrice of a House.
-   The rest of the features contribute just 7% in determination of SalePrice of a House
Visually we have checked that a nice plot occurs for my model . By observing the overlapping between the Actual & Predicted values, we can conclude that our model has performed fairly well.
